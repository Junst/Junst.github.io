CSKG integrates seven sources:

a commonsense knowledge graph ConceptNet, 
a visual commonsense source Visual Genome, 
a procedural source ATOMIC, 
a general-domain source Wikidata, 

three lexical sources, WordNet, Roget, and FrameNet. 

Here, we present our design decisions per source, their integration, and statistics on the resulting CSKG graph. We also present initial investigations on utilizing CSKG for commonsense question answering.
